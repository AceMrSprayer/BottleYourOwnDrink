CRIA project Hogeschool Arnhem Nijmegen

BottleYourOwnDrink is the project concept the SGOP will be realizing during the eight
weeks of the project. This repository contains all the source files and the different

This application is based on a MEAN.IO stack that was pulled from their website.

1. Clone the directory into a folder on your system.
2. Configure both MongoDB and Node.js according to the tutorials on their websites.
3. Make sure the node_modules are installed. If not run 'npm install' in the project root.
4. Make sure you have MEAN.CLI installed globally. If not run 'npm install -g mean-cli'.
5. Make sure that you have installed Gulp. If not run 'npm install gulp'.
6. Start the MongoDB service -> leave this command window open.
7. Open up a command line in the BottleYourOwnDrink root folder.
8. Run the command "gulp" and the application will start up -> leave this command window open as well.
9. The application will now be started on http://localhost:1337.

Possible problems:

Common troubleshooting answers can be found here: http://meanjs.org/docs.html

-ERR: Git is not found. Check if the Git PATH variable is correct and not corrupt.
-ERR: ECONRESET. Then you should npm config set registry 'http://registry.npmjs.org'. This will change HTTPS to HTTP.
